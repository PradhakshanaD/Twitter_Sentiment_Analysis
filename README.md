#Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

##Description:

####This project implements sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization in Python. Sentiment analysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to determine the sentiment or opinion expressed in text data. The dataset used for this project comprises 1.6 million tweets.

##Key Steps:

###Data Preprocessing:
####Text data preprocessing techniques such as stemming and stop-word removal were applied to clean the text and enhance the model's performance.

###Model Training:
####Logistic Regression was chosen as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness for text classification tasks.
####TF-IDF vectorization was employed to convert text data into numerical form, preserving the importance of each word in the dataset.
####The model was trained on the preprocessed tweet data to learn the sentiment patterns present in the text.

###Evaluation:
The trained model was evaluated using a test set to assess its performance in predicting sentiment labels accurately.
The accuracy achieved on the test set was 77.8%, indicating the model's effectiveness in classifying sentiments expressed in tweets.
